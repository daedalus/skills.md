description: >
  Full Python project bootstrapping workflow. Use this skill whenever the user wants to
  build a new Python tool, library, CLI, or module from scratch — especially when they
  mention "create X", "build X in Python", "write a Python project for X", or ask for
  a proper project with tests, linting, versioning, or git setup. Triggers on any
  request to scaffold, initialize, or structure a new Python project. Even if the user
  only says "build me X in Python", apply this skill — it encodes the full professional
  workflow: SPEC → implementation → pytest → README → lint → git. Always use this skill
  rather than improvising a one-off script when the deliverable is a reusable project.
---

# Python Project Scaffold Skill

Build a production-grade Python project from scratch, end-to-end. The workflow is
**strictly sequential**: spec first, code second, tests third, polish fourth, git last.
Never skip or reorder steps.

---

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Understand the Request

The default branch is master.

Before writing a single file, make sure you know:
- What the project does (purpose, inputs, outputs)
- Any constraints (pure stdlib? third-party ok? CLI or library?)
- Target Python version (default: 3.11+)
- Is this a CLI tool, library, or both?

If the user's request is clear enough, proceed directly to Step 1. If ambiguous, ask
one focused clarifying question only.

---

### Step 1 — Setup project internal variables to use later

```
<package_name> Is the package name.
<project_name> Is the project name.
<version> Is the project version (default :"0.1.0").
<project_description> Is the project description.
<is_mcp_server> Is this project about MCP server? (true/false)
<github_username> Is the github username (git config user.githubusername).
<author_name> Is the author name (git config user.name).
<author_email> Is the author email (git config.email).
<target_python> Is the target Python version (default: "3.11").
<ruff_version> Is the ruff version (default: "v0.9.0").
<mypy_version> Is the mypy version (default: "v1.14.0").
<pre_commit_version> Is the pre-commit version (default: "v5.0.0").
<hatch_version> Is the hatch version (default: "latest").
```


### Step 2 — Write SPEC.md First

**Always write SPEC.md before writing any code.** No exceptions.

`SPEC.md` is the contract. Everything that follows must obey it.

```markdown
# SPEC.md — <project_name>

## Purpose
One paragraph: what this project does and why.

## Scope
- What IS in scope (explicit list)
- What is NOT in scope (explicit list)

## Public API / Interface
List every public function, class, CLI command, or module with:
- Signature (name, args, return type)
- Invariants and preconditions
- Error behavior

## Data Formats
Describe input/output data structures, file formats, encodings.

## Edge Cases
List at least 5 edge cases that the implementation must handle correctly.

## Performance & Constraints
Any O(n) requirements, memory limits, forbidden dependencies.

```

After writing SPEC.md, **pause and verify it makes sense** before moving on.

---

### Step 3 — Project Structure

Create the following layout:

```
<project_name>/
├── SPEC.md
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── src/
│   └── <package_name>/
│       ├── __init__.py     # exports version + public API
│       ├── __main__.py    # CLI entry point (if CLI project)
│       ├── py.typed       # type hints marker
│       └── <modules>.py
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── conftest.py
    └── test_<module>.py
```

---

### Step 4 — Internal Subsystem Organization

When a package grows beyond a few modules, separate concerns into distinct subsystems
within `src/<package_name>/`. Each subsystem should be a self-contained package with a
clear responsibility. The following is a non-exhaustive list of common subsystem types
— use only those that apply to your project.

**Layout pattern (examples):**

```
src/<package_name>/
├── __init__.py
├── __main__.py
├── py.typed
├── core/              # Core domain logic, no external dependencies
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── models.py
├── adapters/          # External integrations (API clients, DB, filesystem)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── http.py
│   └── storage.py
├── services/          # Business logic orchestrating core + adapters
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── pipeline.py
├── cli/               # CLI layer (if CLI project)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── commands.py
└── api/               # HTTP/API layer (if applicable)
    ├── __init__.py
    └── routes.py
```

**Rules:**

- `core/` has zero imports from `adapters/`, `services/`, `cli/`, or `api/`
- `adapters/` may import from `core/` but not from `services/`, `cli/`, or `api/`
- `services/` may import from `core/` and `adapters/`, but not from `cli/` or `api/`
- `cli/` and `api/` may import from any subsystem
- Never create catch-all modules like `utils.py` at the package root; place utility
  code near where it's used

**Dependency direction (inward):**

```
cli/api → services → adapters → core
```

This ensures `core` remains testable without external dependencies and can be reused
independently.

---

### Step 5 — pyproject.toml

**Modern configuration with hatchling + ruff + mypy + coverage:**

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "<package_name>"
version = "<version>"
description = "<one-line description>"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=<target_python>"
license = {text = "MIT"}
authors = [
    {name = "<author_name>", email = "<author_email>"}
]
dependencies = []
# Apply ONLY if <is_mcp_server> is true:
# dependencies = ["fastmcp"]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "ruff",
    "mypy",
    "hatch",
    "pip-api",
]
test = [
    "pytest",
    "pytest-cov",
    "pytest-mock",
    "pytest-asyncio",
    "hypothesis",
]
lint = [
    "ruff",
    "mypy",
]
all = ["<package_name>[dev,test,lint]"]

[project.scripts]
<package_name> = "<package_name>.__main__:main"  # if CLI

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/<github_username>/<project_name>"
Repository = "https://github.com/<github_username>/<project_name>"
Issues = "https://github.com/<github_username>/<project_name>/issues"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/<package_name>"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
include = ["src/<package_name>"]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py<target_python>"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "W", "I", "UP", "ANN", "TCH", "N", "C4", "ARG"]
ignore = ["E501"]

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"__init__.py" = ["F401"]

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
convention = "google"

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "<target_python>"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
addopts = "-v --tb=short --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80"
filterwarnings = ["ignore::DeprecationWarning"]

[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
branch = true

[tool.coverage.report]
exclude = ["tests/*", "*/__init__.py"]
exclude_lines = [
    "pragma: no cover",
    "def __repr__",
    "raise AssertionError",
    "raise NotImplementedError",
    "if __name__ == .__main__.:",
    "if TYPE_CHECKING:",
]
```

---

### Step 6 — Implementation

Follow SPEC.md **to the letter**. For each item in the spec's Public API:

- Implement it exactly as specced (name, signature, behavior)
- Add verbose docstrings (comprehensive summary + detailed Args/Returns/Raises/Examples)
- Every function should have at minimum: summary line, extended description, Args section with types, Returns section with types, Raises section, and Examples section where helpful
- Handle all edge cases listed in SPEC.md
- Raise meaningful exceptions with descriptive messages
- Add type hints to all function signatures

**`__init__.py` must export:**

```python
__version__ = "<version>"
__all__ = [...]  # every public symbol

from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from ._core import *
```

**`__main__.py` for CLI projects:**

```python
import sys
from <package_name> import cli

def main() -> int:
    return cli.main()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

**`py.typed` marker file:** Empty file to indicate package provides type hints.

Do not add features not in SPEC.md. If you realize the spec is wrong, update SPEC.md
first, then the code.

---

### Step 7 — Tests (pytest, heavy coverage)

Write tests **before assuming the implementation is correct**. Tests are the spec made
executable.

**Minimum test coverage requirements:**

| Category | Minimum |
|---|---|
| Happy path | 1 test per public function |
| Edge cases | Every edge case in SPEC.md gets a test |
| Error cases | Every documented exception gets a test |
| Boundary values | Empty input, single element, large input |
| Type correctness | Wrong-type args raise TypeError where appropriate |
| Property-based | Use hypothesis for complex functions |

**`conftest.py` pattern:**

```python
import pytest
from hypothesis import given, settings, Verbosity

@given(data=pytest.mark.parametrize(...))
@settings(verbosity=Verbosity.verbose)
def test_something(data):
    ...

@pytest.fixture
def sample_input():
    return ...  # reusable fixture

@pytest.fixture
def mock_external(mocker):
    return mocker.patch(...)
```

**Test naming convention:** `test_<function>_<scenario>`, e.g.:
- `test_parse_empty_string`
- `test_compute_large_n`
- `test_divide_by_zero_raises`

**Run tests and fix everything before moving on:**

```bash
cd <project_root>
pip install -e ".[test]" --quiet
pytest -v
```

All tests must pass. Zero failures, zero errors. Coverage must be >= 80%.

**Verify the package imports correctly:**
```bash
python -c "import <package_name>; print(<package_name>.__version__)"
```

---

### Step 8 — README.md

```markdown
**<package_name>** — One-line description.

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/<package_name>.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/<package_name>/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/<package_name>.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/<package_name>/)
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/<author_name>/<project_name>/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/<author_name>/<project_name>)
[![Ruff](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/ruff/main/assets/badge/v2.json)](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

## Install

```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

## Usage

```python
from <package_name> import <MainThing>

# format
ruff format src/ tests/

# lint
ruff check src/ tests/

# type check
mypy src/
```

```

**Apply this step ONLY if `<is_mcp_server>` is `true`.**

```markdown
mcp-name: io.github.<github_username>/<package_name>
```

---

### Step 9 — CHANGELOG.md

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Added
- Initial release

[<version>]: https://github.com/<github_username>/<project_name>/releases/tag/v<version>
```

---

### Step 13 — GitHub Actions CI

**Write `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the content below:**

```yaml
name: CI

          python -m build

      - name: Check package
        run: pip install twine && python -m twine check dist/*
```

---

### Step 14 — PyPI Publish

**Write `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml` with the content below:**

```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:

        run: uv run python -m twine check dist/*

      - name: Upload dist artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/

  publish:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: pypi
      url: https://pypi.org/p/<project_name>
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Download dist artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          user: __token__
          password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
```

### Step 15 — MCP Registry Publish
**Apply this step ONLY if `<is_mcp_server>` is `true`.**

**`server.json`:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-12-11/server.schema.json",
  "name": "io.github.<github_username>/<project_name>",
  "description": "<project_description>",
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/<github_username>/<project_name>",
    "source": "github"
  },
  "version": "<version>",
  "packages": [
    {
      "registryType": "pypi",
      "identifier": "<project_name>",
      "version": "<version>",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

**`mcp.json`:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<package_name>": {
      "command": "<package_name>",
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}

```

### Step 16 — Publish Python MCP Server

**Apply this step ONLY if `<is_mcp_server>` is `true`.**

**Write `.github/workflows/mcp-publish.yml` with the content below:**
```yaml
name: Publish Python MCP Server

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Publish to PyPI"]
    types:
      - completed
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install MCP Publisher
        run: |
          curl -L "https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/v1.5.0/mcp-publisher_linux_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz mcp-publisher

      - name: Publish to MCP Registry
        run: |
          ./mcp-publisher login github-oidc
          ./mcp-publisher publish
```

---

### Step 17 — Bumpversion Configuration

**`.bumpversion.cfg`:**

```ini
[bumpversion]
current_version = <version>

[bumpversion:file:pyproject.toml]
search = version = "{current_version}"
replace = version = "{new_version}"

[bumpversion:file:src/<project_name>/__init__.py]
search = __version__ = "{current_version}"
replace = __version__ = "{new_version}"
```

**Apply this step ONLY if `<is_mcp_server>` is `true`.**
```ini
[bumpversion:file:server.json]
search = "version": "{current_version}"
replace = "version": "{new_version}"
```

---

### Step 18 — Lint and Type Check

Run linters in order and fix every warning.

```bash
# Install lint dependencies
pip install ruff mypy pytest pytest-cov pre-commit --quiet

# Ruff: format + lint (replaces black + flake8)
ruff format src/ tests/
ruff check src/ tests/ --fix

# MyPy: type checking
mypy src/ tests/

# Run tests
pytest
```

Fix ALL warnings. Do not suppress with `# noqa` unless there is a documented reason.
After fixing, re-run pytest to confirm nothing broke.

---

### Step 19 — Git Init, Commit, Push

```bash
cd <project_root>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial release v<version>

- Implements <short description>
- Full pytest suite with <N> tests (>80% coverage)
- Linted with ruff, type-checked with mypy
- CI/CD workflow configured
- Pre-commit hooks configured"

git remote add origin git@github.com:<github_username>/<project_name>.git
git push -u origin master
```

If no remote URL was given by the user, stop after `git commit` and inform them.

---

### Step 20 — Verify Dependencies on PyPI

Before finalizing, verify all dependencies in `pyproject.toml` exist on PyPI:

```bash
# Extract all dependencies from pyproject.toml and check each one
pip install --quiet pip-api 2>/dev/null || pip install pip-api

python3 << 'EOF'
import tomllib
import pip_api

with open("pyproject.toml", "rb") as f:
    data = tomllib.load(f)

deps = data.get("project", {}).get("dependencies", [])
for extra, extra_deps in data.get("project", {}).get("optional-dependencies", {}).items():
    deps.extend(extra_deps)

# Extract package names (remove version specifiers)
import re
for dep in deps:
    pkg_name = re.split(r"[<>=!~]", dep)[0].strip()
    try:
        pip_api.pypi_project(pkg_name)
        print(f"✓ {pkg_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ {pkg_name}: NOT FOUND - {e}")
        exit(1)

print("\nAll dependencies verified on PyPI!")
EOF
```

This gate prevents hallucinated package names from being committed. If any package fails, fix `pyproject.toml` before proceeding.

---

## CLI Projects (click/typer)

For CLI projects, add to dependencies:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
cli = ["click>=8.0"]
```

Or use typer:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
cli = ["typer>=0.9", "rich>=13.0"]
```

Use click/typer decorators for CLI structure:

**Click:**
```python
import click

@click.command()
@click.argument("input")
@click.option("-o", "--output", help="Output file")
@click.option("-v", "--verbose", is_flag=True, help="Verbose output")
def main(input: str, output: str | None, verbose: bool) -> None:
    """CLI tool description."""
    ...
```

**Typer:**
```python
import typer
from typing import Optional

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def main(
    input: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Input file"),
    output: Optional[str] = typer.Option(None, "-o", "--output", help="Output file"),
    verbose: bool = typer.Option(False, "-v", "--verbose", help="Verbose output"),
) -> None:
    """CLI tool description."""
    ...
```

Ensure `pyproject.toml` has `[project.scripts]` entry:

```toml
[project.scripts]
<package_name> = "<package_name>.__main__:main"
```

---

## MCP Server Projects (fastmcp)

**Apply this step ONLY if `<is_mcp_server>` is `true`.**

For MCP server projects, use fastmcp:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
mcp = ["fastmcp"]
```

Implement the MCP server using fastmcp:

```python
import fastmcp

mcp = fastmcp.FastMCP("<package_name>")

@mcp.tool()
def your_tool(arg: str) -> str:
    """Tool description."""
    ...

@mcp.resource("resource://name")
def your_resource() -> str:
    ...
```

**Every function of every tool must have proper documentation with at least one example.**

```python
@mcp.tool()
def your_tool(arg: str) -> str:
    """Short description of what the tool does.

    Args:
        arg: Description of the argument.

    Returns:
        Description of the return value.

    Example:
        >>> your_tool("example_input")
        "expected_output"
    """
    ...
```

For stdio transport, ensure `__main__.py` runs the server:

```python
import sys
from <package_name> import mcp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Step 21 - Quality Gates


Before declaring the project done, verify every item:

- [ ] SPEC.md exists and is complete
- [ ] All public API in SPEC.md is implemented
- [ ] All edge cases in SPEC.md have a test
- [ ] `pytest` exits with 0 failures
- [ ] `python -c "import <package_name>"` succeeds
- [ ] Coverage >= 80%
- [ ] `ruff format --check src/ tests/` exits cleanly
- [ ] `ruff check src/ tests/` exits cleanly
- [ ] `mypy src/` exits cleanly
- [ ] `__version__ == "<version>"` in `__init__.py`
- [ ] README.md present with install + usage example
- [ ] `mcp-name` present in README.md (if `<is_mcp_server>` is true)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md present
- [ ] LICENSE present
- [ ] pyproject.toml has `readme = "README.md"`
- [ ] `.gitignore` present
- [ ] `.github/workflows` directory present
- [ ] `.pre-commit-config.yaml` present
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` present
- [ ] `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml` present
- [ ] `.github/workflows/mcp-publish.yml` present
- [ ] `.bumpversion.cfg` present 
- [ ] `py.typed` marker file present
- [ ] `git log` shows at least one commit
- [ ] All dependencies verified on PyPI (Step 14)
- [ ] Step 19 complete: git initialized, at least one commit exists, remote configured and pushed

## Common Pitfalls

**Don't skip SPEC.md.** The temptation to jump to code is always wrong. The spec forces
clarity about edge cases before they become bugs.

**Don't write tests after the fact as a formality.** Tests should falsify your
implementation. Write at least one test you expect might fail.

**Don't ignore linter/type warnings.** Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

**Don't use `# noqa` as a first resort.** It's a last resort with a comment explaining
why.

**Ruff replaces black + flake8.** Don't install both; ruff handles formatting and linting.

**Use hatchling as build backend.** It's the modern default, faster and simpler
than legacy setuptools.

**`src/` layout requires `pip install -e .`** to be importable. Remind the user if they
get `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**Don't forget `py.typed`** if you want type hints to work for downstream consumers.

**Always add `readme = "README.md"`** in `[project]` section of pyproject.toml
for proper package metadata.

**Version management:** For production projects, consider using `hatch` or
`setuptools-scm` for automatic version management.

**Language:** Make sure the code and the main documentation is always in english.

**README.md** Make sure it's not vague.
